# Vanilla Fireworks
Whether you have saw real fireworks or not, Fireworks gives an outstanding and eye-catching appearance to make any moment beautiful!  Who doesn't love fireworks? At present it's easy to get something close to home with some handy lines of Javascript and CSS. 😀

The objective of this project is to represent (may be the closer) fireworks in HTML + CSS + JS using plain DOM object aka DIV elements, without a bunch of scary mathematics, calculations, just easily. It can be a useful project for any webpage, personal site (or project) for occasional purposes like celebration of joy 🥳, accepting invitation, getting rewards and so on. (Just imagine a new scene where you gonna do this! 😉) 

The another part denotes the use of pure Javascript, as a message to not be dependent on libraries when you really don't need them. Also CSS variables have made more easier to interact with real-time coding and unlocked millions of opportunities to show your creativity.
